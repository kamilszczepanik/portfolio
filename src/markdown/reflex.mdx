## Problem

I used to play this card game with my family and friends a lot when I was growing up. Sadly it was impossible after I moved to Dubai and I missed it so much, so I've created the mobile version of it with slight twist. I wanted to create a fast-paced, real-time multiplayer card game that could be played in short bursts with friends or strangers, combining the excitement of speed-based card games with modern mobile gaming convenience.

## Solution

REFLEX is a real-time multiplayer mobile card game that brings the classic speed-based solitaire experience to mobile devices. Players compete head-to-head to empty their hands first by playing cards onto shared middle piles following chaining rules.
